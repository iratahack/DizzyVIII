# Dizzy VIII - Wonderful Dizzy

Here you will find a ZX Spectrum pok file to assist your Wonderful Dizzy adventure.

## Protection from baddies

This poke will protect you from most of the baddies, excluding flying monkeys.

## Protection from flying monkeys
Prevent your power bar from going down while the pesky monkeys have you in the air. Also, just jumping across the screen will prevent them from grabbing you. The poke below is also useful to protect you when they drop you.

## Protection from falling too far

Do lose any power when you fall too far.

## Water

Do not fall into water. This will kill you instantly. Apparently Dizzy sinks.

## Poppies

Watch out for the poppy field it will also kill you.
